# About

Connery is based on the work of [Daniel Holden](http://www.theorangeduck.com/page/about) and his fantastic book [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) and library [mpc](https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc). It is also inspired by [ArnoldC](https://lhartikk.github.io/ArnoldC/) as well as countless other joke programming languages. It was created by [Will Cipriano](https://thoughts.willcipriano.com/contact/).
