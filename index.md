## Connery has several of the features you have come to expect from a programming language
You can assign variables
```
(def {james_bonds_car} "Aston Martin DB5")
(print james_bonds_car)
```
```
Aston Martin DB5
```
You can create functions and conditional statements
```
(fun {toggle_caterpillar_drive caterpillar_drive_status} {
      if (caterpillar_drive_status)
         {False}
         {True}
})
```
You can complete mathematical operations using Polish notation
```
(- 90 1)
```
```
89
```
Connery supports dynamic typing...
```
(def {this_is_a_string} "Bond. James Bond.")
(def {this_is_a_number} 007)
```
type validation...
```
(print (type_string this_is_a_string))
```
```
String
```
string manipulation...
```
(def {connery_quote} "There is nothing like a challenge to bring out the best in man.")
(split connery_quote (find connery_quote " to"))
```
```
{"There is nothing like a challenge" " to bring out the best in man."}
```
and so much more!
```
(def {highlanders} (list "Connor MacLeod" "Ram√≠rez" "Rachel Ellenstein" "Methos"))
(def {highlanders} (join highlanders (list "General Katana")))
(fun {there_can_only_be_one highlander} {!= -1 (caseless_find highlander "MACLEOD")})
(fun {pick_highlander_to_mentor list} {eval (filter there_can_only_be_one list)})
(pick_highlander_to_mentor highlanders)
```
```
"Connor MacLeod"
```
## How is this Sean Connery themed?
When you make a mistake, Connery lets you know with a signature scottish lisp!
```
shtirred: filter requiresh a function and a lisht ash input!
