<p align="center">Connery is a experimental lisp-like interpreted programming language that is somewhat themed after veteran actor Sean Connery.</p>

## Connery has a few of the features you have come to expect from a programming language

```
;You can make comments, and assign variables
(def {aston_martin_db5} "James Bond")

;You can complete mathematical operations using Polish notation
(def {sean_connery_age} (- 90 1))
```
