# Version History

### Version 0.0.3 - 10/28/2021
Connery now has a proper garbage collector, and a mutable hash table type called the dictionary. The allocator has been improved and now it is possible to learn more about objects via a new inspect builtin. General stability is getting decent for a joke.
